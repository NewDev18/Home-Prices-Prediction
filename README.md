# Home-Prices-Prediction
This project contains predicting  Banglore Home Prices

Following series of steps were involved in this project. 

1. Data Exploration and Understanding:
a. Load the Dataset:
- Import the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy).
- Load the dataset into a DataFrame.

b. Explore the Data:
- Display basic information about the dataset (head, info, describe).
- Check for missing values.
- Understand the structure of the dataset (columns, data types).

c. Visualize the Data:
- Use visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to understand the distribution of numerical features.
- Explore relationships between variables.

2. Data Cleaning:
a. Handle Missing Values:
- Decide on a strategy for handling missing data (imputation, removal).

b. Outlier Detection and Handling:
- Identify and handle outliers if necessary.

c. Feature Engineering:
- Create new features if needed.
- Transform existing features (e.g., log transformations).

3. Data Preprocessing:
a. Categorical Variable Encoding:
- Apply one-hot encoding or other encoding techniques to handle categorical variables.

b. Feature Scaling:
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.

c. Train-Test Split:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Model Selection:
a. Choose a Regression Model:
- Select a regression algorithm suitable for predicting home prices (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

b. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation.

5. Model Training:
a. Fit the Model:
- Train the selected model using the training dataset.
