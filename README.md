# Home-Prices-Prediction
This project contains predicting  Banglore Home Prices

Following series of steps were involved in this project. 

1. Data Exploration and Understanding:

a. Loading the Dataset:

- Importing the necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy).
- Loading the dataset into a DataFrame.

b. Exploreing the Data:

- Displaying basic information about the dataset (head, info, describe).
- Checking for missing value.
- Understanding the structure of the dataset (columns, data types).

c. Visualizeing the Data:

- Using visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to understand the distribution of numerical features.
- Explore relationships between variables.



2. Data Cleaning:

a. Handling Missing Values:
- Deciding on a strategy for handling missing data (imputation, removal).

b. Outlier Detection and Handling:
- Identifying and handle outliers if necessary.

c. Feature Engineering:
- Creating new features if needed.
- Transforming existing features (e.g., log transformations).



3. Data Preprocessing:
a. Categorical Variable Encoding:
- Apply one-hot encoding or other encoding techniques to handle categorical variables.

b. Feature Scaling:
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.

c. Train-Test Split:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.



4. Model Selection:
a. Choose a Regression Model:
- Select a regression algorithm suitable for predicting home prices (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

b. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters using technique like cross-validation.



5. Model Training:
a. Fit the Model:
- Train the selected model using the training dataset.
